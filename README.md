# Image-Similarity-Check

Determine the similarity percentage between two pictures using the most traditional method there is, cosine similarity. 

Although simple, cosine similarity is still able to successfully identify pictures that are similar and are not. Unfortunately, there are some conditions in which the program is unsuccessful. 

This project shows how even simple mathematics like cosine can perform incredible feats such as image similarity. Imagine how incredibly complex mathematics can accomplish.

## Executions

Store the images desired to compare in the same directory. In this example, the filenames are toby-maguire-spiderman and tom-holland-spiderman with both in webp file format.

Execute the program
```
python3 imageSimilarity.py
```

Input the filenames of the pictures
```
Input the first photo file name: toby-maguire-spiderman.webp
Input the second photo file name: tom-holland-spiderman.webp
```

Below is the similarity score resulted from the program
```
The similarity score between the two pictures is 74%
